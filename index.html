            So how does it work?
            <br />
            Pick a task you want to get done (eg. fixing a specific bug, writing
            a blog post) and set a timer for 25 minutes. You could use a ticking
            kitchen timer if you want to go old school, but if you work in an
            open office that might not be the best idea.
            <br />
            When those 25 minutes are up, set the timer for five minutes. What
            do you do in those five minutes? Take a break.

            How should you space your learning?
            <br />
            Start planning early – the beginning of the semester, or even
            earlier. Set aside a bit of time every day, just for studying, even
            if your exams are months away. Review information from each class,
            but not immediately after class. A good way to do this is to reserve
            some time one day after each of your classes meet.Spacing your
            learning doesn’t mean you won’t be studying at all right before the
            exam. You can still study up until the exam – but instead of only
            studying then, spread it out so that you’re studying days and weeks
            before the exam as well.

            Make your own practice questions/quizzes. Initially, read and test
            yourself over new material (this type of test is called “free
            recall”). Then while the material is still fresh, go back and write
            a few questions to use as practice quiz questions. Testing yourself
            with specific questions is known as “cued recall,” because the
            question itself reminds you of the topics to be remembered. Use your
            practice questions to self-test each time you study. Cued recall
            questions make self-testing a bit easier than trying to remember and
            write down everything you remember as in free recall.

            When you are learning two or more related concepts or skills,
            instead of focusing exclusively on one concept or skill at a time,
            it can be helpful to alternate between them (for example, if you are
            learning topic A and topic B, rather than practice only A on one day
            and only B on the next, you can practice both on each day by
            incorporating a mixture of the two topics or by switching back and
            forth between them). Examples of materials that interleaved practice
            can benefit include similar types of math problems (for example,
            calculating volumes of different shapes), easily confused
            grammatical tenses, and similar classes of visual stimuli.

          I`ve somehow managed to survive during my first academic year. It was
          truly hard but I succeeded!!! I was bombarded with lots of homework
          and didn`t rest properly. So as you can guess I eventually had burnout
          for a month and couldn`t do my work properly.
          <br />
          It was really hard to pull myself together. I needed to change my
          learning methods to reach my goal I went on Youtube and found lots of
          work-life balance content. I was so inspired and try them. Some of
          them worked for me some of them didn`t. But the results were obvious I
          stopped feeling swayed in my uni task and started doing sport again. I
          also started to pay more attention to what I eat and my screen time.
          Basically, my time management skills were so awful but I combat it.

          I truly started to understand the value of my time and came up with a
          simple conclusion I don`t want to spend it on people who don`t do the
          same. I learned that I should be the version of the people I want
          around me. All of it costs time and endeavor I need to pay the price.
          It isn`t an easy way, but I am eager to go this path.
          <br />
          This study technique helps me to learn that I don`t need to reread my
          notes lots of time or that simply rewriting lection`s materials is a
          useless staff. They show me how to learn more in a short time. As a
          result, it became my academic weapon, and I did well on my exam
          without sacrificing my time wholly
