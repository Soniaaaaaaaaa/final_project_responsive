            So how does it work?
            <br />
            Pick a task you want to get done (eg. fixing a specific bug, writing
            a blog post) and set a timer for 25 minutes. You could use a ticking
            kitchen timer if you want to go old school, but if you work in an
            open office that might not be the best idea.
            <br />
            When those 25 minutes are up, set the timer for five minutes. What
            do you do in those five minutes? Take a break.

            How should you space your learning?
            <br />
            Start planning early – the beginning of the semester, or even
            earlier. Set aside a bit of time every day, just for studying, even
            if your exams are months away. Review information from each class,
            but not immediately after class. A good way to do this is to reserve
            some time one day after each of your classes meet.Spacing your
            learning doesn’t mean you won’t be studying at all right before the
            exam. You can still study up until the exam – but instead of only
            studying then, spread it out so that you’re studying days and weeks
            before the exam as well.

            Make your own practice questions/quizzes. Initially, read and test
            yourself over new material (this type of test is called “free
            recall”). Then while the material is still fresh, go back and write
            a few questions to use as practice quiz questions. Testing yourself
            with specific questions is known as “cued recall,” because the
            question itself reminds you of the topics to be remembered. Use your
            practice questions to self-test each time you study. Cued recall
            questions make self-testing a bit easier than trying to remember and
            write down everything you remember as in free recall.

            when you are learning two or more related concepts or skills,
            instead of focusing exclusively on one concept or skill at a time,
            it can be helpful to alternate between them (for example, if you are
            learning topic A and topic B, rather than practice only A on one day
            and only B on the next, you can practice both on each day by
            incorporating a mixture of the two topics or by switching back and
            forth between them). Examples of materials that interleaved practice
            can benefit include similar types of math problems (for example,
            calculating volumes of different shapes), easily confused
            grammatical tenses, and similar classes of visual stimuli.
